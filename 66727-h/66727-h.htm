</div>

<p>When the rumor first came across the water, a
few years ago, of that wonderful and fascinating
little two-wheeled machine, upon which one could
so gracefully annihilate time and space, the author
of this little book was seized with his first attack of
Velocipede Fever.</p>

<p>When, in the spring of 1868, we heard how popular
this invention was becoming in France, how
much it was ridden in Paris; in its Boulevards, its
Bois de Boulogne, and on the smooth paths of the
Champs Elysées; how it was employed for amusement
in the Garden of the Tuileries, and by the
laborer in the suburbs going to his daily toil; how
exhilarating to the gentleman, how useful to the messenger
and post-boy, we were again seized with the
disease with renewed virulence.</p>

<p>We could hardly delay for one from across the
Atlantic, and embraced the first opportunity to learn
the art of riding. While learning, with bruised elbows
and scraped knees, with the bicycle more of
the time on us than we on it, we felt how usefully
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
we could employ a few hints of instruction, and how
invaluable we should find some little book that would
tell us all about the machine.</p>

<p>After we were somewhat proficient, we were
amazed that we had not learned before, and saw
how easily we could have done so, if we had only
been a little informed of the method of procedure.</p>

<p>When we proposed purchasing, we were all adrift,
as likely to buy a poor machine as a good one, and
anxiously scanned the papers, and inquired of friends
concerning the merits and demerits of each patent
and make.</p>

<p>So far as we can learn, there has been no book
written upon the Velocipede, either abroad or in this
country.</p>

<p>It is the design of this little work, not only to give
a few simple directions to guide the beginner, but to
give the history of the machine from its first origin,
to treat accurately and impartially of the strength,
lightness, superiority, and inferiority of each important
machine and patent, and to collect such facts,
statistics, and items, as may be of use and information
to any one interested in the subject.</p>

<p>We think it an invention which will not have an
ephemeral popularity, but which will, in its way, revolutionize
travel for all time. We love the velocipede,
and can truly quote, “Amor jussit scribere.”</p>

<p>We wish to thank the various manufacturers for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
their kindness in giving us information, and to
acknowledge our indebtedness to various newspapers
that have fallen in our way, to the “Scientific
American,” to the “Galaxy,” and to the “Velocipedist,”
and its genial and accomplished young editor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_VELOCIPEDE">THE VELOCIPEDE:</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">ITS HISTORY AND ORIGIN.</p>

<p>We have spent much time in fruitless and weary
researches over old French books and musty journals,
and have found that there is but very little about the
Velocipede, in the literature, or dictionaries and encyclopedias
of ancient or modern times.</p>

<p>In the “Journal de Paris” of July 27, 1779, there
is a description of a vehicle invented by Messrs.
Blanchard and Mesurier, the former the celebrated
aeronaut, which was exhibited on the Place Louis
XV., named to-day Place de Concorde, in the presence
of many members of the French Academy and
a large concourse of spectators. At the head of the
machine was the figure of an eagle, with outspread
wings, to which was attached the apparatus with
which the driver directed its movements. Behind it
was seated an individual who propelled the machine.
At a subsequent date, the inventor transported the
vehicle to Versailles, and exhibited its capabilities,
in the presence of Louis XVI., Marie Antoinette,
and their effeminate court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
At a later date M. Dreuze made an improvement
on this invention, which met with some success as a
toy. A number of these machines were constructed
after his model, and distributed among country postmen,
who used the novelty for a time, until a heavy
fall of snow rendered them unserviceable, when they
were abandoned, greatly to the gratification of a conservative
class, who, detesting anything in the way
of innovation, had prophesied their failure.</p>

<p>The article upon the Velocipede in the “American
Encyclopedia,” commences by giving the well-known
derivation of the word from the Latin <i>velox</i>, swift,
and <i>pes</i>, a foot, and defines it as a carriage, by means
of which the rider propels himself along the ground,
and states that it was invented at Manheim.</p>

<p>In a little old French book called “Dictionnaire
de Conversation,” under the word <i>Velocipede</i>, we
are referred to the word <i>Drasienne</i>, on turning to
which, we find a description of the three-wheeled
arm movement Velocipede, and the credit of its invention
ascribed to Baron Charles Drais de Saverbrun,
at Manheim, at the early commencement of the
nineteenth century. The Drasienne, though a decidedly
crude idea, differed very materially from the
clumsy structure of Messrs. Blanchard and Mesurier.</p>

<p>Baron Drais de Saverbrun seems to be universally
considered the inventor of the germ, which has developed
into the present improved Velocipede. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
was a man of considerable scientific attainments,
and author of several works; son of a lawyer, himself
a landscape gardener; and died at Carlsruhe,
December 12, 1851. He was master of the woods
and forests of the Grand Duke of Baden, and rode
about upon the Drasienne, while performing his official
duties.</p>

<p>This invention made its <i>début</i> in 1816, in the garden
of Tivoli, which was at that time the favorite
resort of the <i>crême de la crême</i> of Parisian society.
As originally constructed it appears to have been of
the most simple kind. It consisted of a bar five feet
long, supported at each end upon a single wheel, that
designed for the front being so arranged as to turn
obliquely to the line of the carriage. The rider sat
astride the bar, and propelled the machine by the
action of the feet upon the ground. The motion
was much like walking upon the heels; as the feet
were brought down flat, the heels were the first to
touch. The vehicle was never generally patronized,
because the pleasure of riding it was counterbalanced
by the labor of propelling it. It was called the “Célérifère,”
or “makespeed,” and many shafts of ridicule
were leveled mercilessly at it. The mode of
propelling it was not graceful, and this ridicule was
not without foundation. It disappeared from view
in France almost as rapidly as its inventor expected
it to roll into public favor.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
This novel vehicle, under the name of “Drasina”
was introduced into England in 1818, and, at first,
the greatest possible expectations were created, with
regard to its usefulness and speed. It was maintained,
that it would travel up-hill on a post-road as
fast as a man could walk; that on a level, even after
a heavy rain, it would average six or seven miles an
hour; and that, on a descent, it would equal a horse
at full speed. It was described in the advertisements
of the day as “consisting of two wheels, one behind
the other, connected by a perch, on which a saddle is
placed as a seat. The front wheel is made to turn
on a pivot, guided by a circular lever or rudder, which
comes up to the hand; <i>the fore-arms rest on a cushion
in front</i>; in this position, both hands holding the
rudder firmly, the machine and traveller are preserved
<i>in equilibrio</i>.”</p>

<p>In 1821 Lewis Gompertz of Surrey, introduced
some decided improvements upon the Drasina, as
will be seen from the accompanying engraving, extracted
from the 39th volume of the English “Repertory
of Arts.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp90" id="i_011" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_011.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The object of the improvement of Gompertz was
to bring the arms of the rider into action, in assistance
to his legs. It consisted “in the application of
a handle, C, which is to be worked backwards and
forwards, to which is attached a circular rack, D G,
which works in a pinion, E, with ratch wheel on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
front wheel of the velocipede, and which, on being
pulled by the rider with both hands, sends the machine
forward; and when thrust from him does not
send it back again, on account of the ratch, which
allows the pinion to turn in that direction, free of the
wheel. H is the saddle, and the rest, B is so made
that the breast of the rider bears against it, while the
sides come around him at some distance below the
arms, and is stuffed.” The rider could with this machine
either propel it entirely without the feet, or he
could use the feet, while the arms were free. The
beam, A, was made of beech wood, and a pivot at
F, allowed the front wheel to be turned to the right
or left at the will of the rider. This must have been,
although somewhat clumsily shaped, quite an efficient
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
machine, good for the times&mdash;forty-eight years
ago. It will be seen that it has many features
in common with the one now in vogue, though the
difference in the manner of propelling completely
changes the character of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Among those who distinguished themselves on the
velocipede in England was Michael Faraday the
chemist, who frequently drove his machine through
the suburbs of London.</p>

<p>The velocipede was cultivated most assiduously
for some little time by the sporting gentry of England;
but Lord George Bentinck and other persons
of fashion finally pronounced so decidedly against it,
that it descended to the vulgar level of a plaything
for young people, and ceased to be regarded in any
other light than that of a toy or hobby. While the
fever lasted, a shoemaker of London made much
money by the manufacture of a strong shoe, soled
with iron, which greatly aided the feet of the “Velocipeders,”
as they went over the ground.</p>

<p>William Howitt, in his “Visits to Remarkable
Places,” a book published in 1841, makes mention
of the velocipede as follows&mdash;the passage is taken
from a description of Alnwick Castle, the ancient seat
of the Percy family: “Among the curiosities laid up
here, are also two velocipedes, machines which twenty
years ago were for a short period much in vogue.
One young man of my acquaintance rode on one of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
these wooden horses all the way from London to
Falkirk in Scotland, and was requested at various
towns to exhibit his management of it to the ladies
and gentlemen of the place. He afterward made a
long excursion to France upon it. He was a very
adroit velocipedean, and was very much amused with
the circumstance of a gentleman meeting him by the
river side, who, requesting to be allowed to try it,
and being shown how he must turn the handle in
order to guide it, set off with great spirit, but turning
the wrong way, soon found himself hurrying to the
edge of the river, where in his flurry, instead of turning
the handle the other way, he began lustily shouting
‘Woh!’ ‘woh!’ and so crying plunged headlong
into the stream. The Duke’s horse, which is laid up
here for the gratification of posterity, was, I believe,
not so unruly; yet I was told its pranks caused it to
be disused and here stabled. It is said that the duke
and his physicians used to amuse themselves with
careering about the grounds on these steeds; but one
day being somewhere on the terrace, his grace’s Trojan
steed capsized, and rolled over and over with him
down the green bank, much to the amusement of a
troop of urchins who were mounted on a wall by the
road to witness this novel kind of racing. On this
accident the velocipede was laid up in lavender, and
a fine specimen of the breed it is. I asked the old
porter if the story was true, but he only said, ‘Mind!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
I did not tell you that. Don’t pretend to say, if you
write any account of this place, that you had that
from me.’”</p>

<p>The machine was introduced into New York in
1819, where it was given the English name of “Hobby-horse”
or “Dandy-horse.” The excitable citizens
went into an ecstasy of astonishment and delight,
and the manufacturers found it impossible to meet
the demand. A place was opened for their exhibition
near Bowling Green, and people used to run on
them up and down the Bowery, and the hill that led
from Chatham Street to the City Hall Park. The
rage for them soon extended throughout the country;
and we hear of them in Philadelphia, Yonkers, Troy,
Saratoga, and Boston. At Troy in the fall of 1819,
a firm, Davis and Rogers, manufactured a number of
machines, and used to let them to the young bloods
about town, at twenty-five cents an hour. In Boston
they became quite common, and, moonlight
nights, students from the classic shades of Old Harvard
could be seen running them across the long
bridge into the city.</p>

<p>In a New York paper of those days we find an interesting
account of a newly invented velocipede for
ladies then building “by a distinguished artist.” “It
is to have beams, or bodies on springs, and four
wheels which will insure its safety. It is to quarter
on the road like other carriages; and with four <i>impellers</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
it is supposed it will proceed with astonishing
rapidity; but its peculiar recommendation is to be
conveyance of two ladies and two <i>impellers</i> at the
rate of six miles an hour.”</p>

<p>The “Ladies Literary Cabinet” (published corner
Chatham and Duane streets), of Saturday, August 9,
1819, gives a very amusing account of a hoax which
seems to have completely deceived the citizens:
“<span class="smcap">Velocipede Hoax.</span> Some mischievous wag on
Saturday last, caused printed hand-bills to be distributed,
announcing that on Monday at five o’clock
precisely, a velocipede would start from the head of
Chatham Square, and proceed to St. Paul’s Church
in less than two minutes, and that it would afterward
be exhibited in the Park, etc. Notwithstanding
the rain on Monday, the people began to collect
at an early hour, so that before five o’clock Chatham
Street was literally crowded from one end to the
other. Every window from the basement to the
attic was thrown open, and filled with the beautiful
heads of ladies and children, exposed to the incessant
searching mist, which robbed their lovely tresses
of every curl which the morning’s industry had
created. But female fortitude and curiosity combined,
are not to be shaken by wind and weather.
For more than an hour did the throng continue to
increase, until it was almost impossible to pass the
street with or without a velocipede. In the mean
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
time, the Park was also crowded, and the City Hall
exhibited the appearance of a gala-day. It is needless
to say that no velocipede appeared.”</p>

<p>Since that time down to a recent day, when M.
Lallement, of France, took it in hand, all experiments
to render the machine subservient to practical
purposes appear to have been unsatisfactory, and it
has only been used as a toy, with the modification
of a third wheel. M. Lallement succeeded in affixing
to the front wheel of the two-wheeled machine,
treadles which should be acted upon by the feet.
His success attending his endeavors to ride it, was
beyond his most sanguine expectations. After becoming
a thorough master of the tandem team, he
appeared upon the Champs Elysées, and created a
genuine <i>furore</i>. People not only wondered that
such a strange machine should run so swiftly, but
that it should run at all upon two wheels in a line.
He obtained a patent upon his velocipede, and sold
it to Messrs. Michaux &amp; Co., of Paris, who have
since improved much upon it. M. Lallement, with
James Carroll, of New Haven, Conn., obtained a
patent in this country in 1866.</p>

<p>The machines now in use are so radically different
from those of fifty years ago, so perfect in propelling
power, so easy to ride, so swift of motion, so useful
as a means of conveyance, that it seems impossible
for history to repeat itself with regard to the present
mania.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_BICYCLE">THE BICYCLE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Of the various kinds of velocipedes, four, three,
two, and one wheeled, the bicycle seems to be considered
the most artistic, is altogether the most in
favor, and steadily maintains its ground against all
rivals. Whether it will be the model velocipede of
the future remains to be seen. The various experiments
now being tried will, no doubt, eventually
result in a nearly perfect machine, but it will require
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
a season’s experience fully to develop the ingenuity
of our American artisans.</p>

<p>Many have expressed doubts as to the real utility
of the velocipede, and the permanency of its use.
They seem to think it a frivolous invention only calculated
to serve purposes of amusement, and soon
to be superseded by some other ephemeral claimant
for popularity. Most of these have based their opinions
upon the disuse into which rude machines have
fallen in former times. But the difference in the
construction of the modern velocipede from the
primitive one has entirely changed the character of
the vehicle. It is no longer a draft vehicle, but a
locomotive, and as much superior to the original bar
on wheels, as the improved steam locomotive is to
the old time stage-coach.</p>

<p>We believe in the utility, convenience, and economy
of the innovation, as well as in its capacity for
affording amusement, and developing strength and
skill; and believe as now improved, it is destined
to mark an era in the history of vehicles. It has
passed the period of being a mere toy, and although
as the novelty wears away, there may be less enthusiasm,
it will continue to be used, and in an increasing
degree, for street locomotion. With those who
live in the cities and require a daily exercise, exhilarating,
pleasant, healthful, and free from expense;
with those who reside in the country and have long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
distances to traverse daily in reaching the scene of
their labors, or with those who have leisure and
wealth at their command, but love such exercises as
afford an opportunity for the display of grace, agility,
and skill, the velocipede has already become as great
a favorite in this country as it is in France and England.</p>

<p>Its want of adaptability to the roughly paved
road-ways of our cities, is already, in a great measure,
overcome, and experience has proved its facility <i>in
rure</i>. We have seen the bicycle run with ease on
country roads, and dashing with full speed through
city streets, totally regardless of curbstones or crossings.
In New York, no matter where you go, a
velocipede is sure to whiz past you. The school-boy
rides up Fifth Avenue in the morning, with his books
strapped before him. In Broadway, where stages,
wagons, carts, trucks, and carriages, clog the street
from morning till night, the iron steed may be seen
gracefully cutting its way among the larger vehicles.</p>

<p>The exercise is not tiresome, except to the beginner.
We have found twelve miles on a country
road no more fatiguing than a brisk walk of two.
We believe a man may ride and drive one at the
rate of ten miles an hour, with less fatigue than he
could walk one quarter of that distance. Some people
ride easier than others, as some skate easier.
Some people make hard work of anything. Lazy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
people will never fall in love with the bicycle, because
to ride one requires all the faculties to be alive and
in action. To keep one’s balance, however, does
not require that constant labor and exertion which
novices suppose. “Familiarity breeds contempt,”
the old adage says. Familiarity with the bicycle
becomes a sort of second nature, and a velocipedean,
after a fair amount of experience, finds himself almost
as perfectly at home astride his two-wheeler,
as he does on his feet.</p>

<p>When John Brent rode his horse across the plains
in search of adventure, the era of the two-wheeled
velocipede had not come upon us. We think the
bicycle an animal, which will, in a great measure,
supersede the horse. It does not cost as much; it
will not eat, kick, bite, get sick, or die. It requires
no stabling, no feed, no water, no curry-comb. It
never “balks,” or “rares up.” It never needs a halter
or a harness. It is light, and little, and leans
lovingly against you for support. Its gait is uniform
and easy, beautiful and exhilarating to see, and simple
to analyze. It glides along with smooth grace,
as though it were alive.</p>

<p>Young America is pictured coming in on a velocipede.
Henry Ward Beecher thinks the coming man
will ride one, and we shall not be surprised to see
his prediction fulfilled, and devout worshippers propelling
themselves to church on Sunday with all due
gravity and decorum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
Velocipeding is a hopeful sign of progress. If
that man is a benefactor who makes two blades of
grass grow where but one grew before, he should
come in for a share of praise, who teaches a man to
go ten miles as easily and as quickly as he previously
went one. “Time is money;” and whatever of it
is saved is often so much cash. As the velocipede
serves its purpose in this direction, it may be regarded
as a good savings institution.</p>

<p>We think that decided good will grow out of this
invention. Riding the velocipede affords pleasurable
excitement, which is what most men drink liquor
for, and it leaves no sting behind. It takes men
from the bar-rooms out into the pure air, into God’s
light and sunshine, and braces their lungs with the
very breath of Heaven. It stimulates them to save
what they would otherwise spend foolishly, that they
may invest it in a machine which is a source of
health and pleasure, as well as of utility. It is an
inducement to young men who work in close apartments
to spend more time in the open air, and furnishes
them a means of healthful, invigorating, and,
at the same time, pleasant exercise, such as nothing
else can possibly afford.</p>

<p>Serious accidents on the velocipede are almost
unheard of, and the predictions that these machines
would prove dangerous have not been verified. It
will fall down, but the rider need not fall with it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
unless he chooses. It is no more dangerous than a
horse and carriage, under any circumstances, and
not nearly so much so, with ordinary caution.</p>

<p>The speed attained by the swifter kind of velocipede
on the roads, averages from twelve to thirteen
miles an hour. On a smooth, level floor, such a
speed can be maintained with but little effort on
almost any machine. It is safe to say that a good
velocipede rider can travel a hundred miles as quickly
as an ordinary horse with an ordinary load. Of
course, the more a person rides, the easier it becomes,
and the less the fatigue.</p>

<p>In impelling a velocipede, the limbs are not constantly
in motion; for on level ground, when the
impetus is at the average rate, or when the machine
is descending an incline, the feet may be removed
from the pedals, and the legs be placed on the bar,
fixed in front of the machine for that purpose. A
slight impulsion to the vehicle from time to time suffices
to keep up the speed. When a rider encounters
a formidable hill, he can dismount and lead his bicycle
by the hand. He can do this with almost the
same ease that he can carry an ordinary walking-stick.
A hill, to be insurmountable, has to be, however,
of more than average steepness. Though
Massachusetts is proverbially hilly, there is no ascent
between Boston and Worcester, a distance of
thirty miles, that cannot be ridden over with the
bicycle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
The best speed thus far attained on the road is a
mile in a few seconds over three minutes. A gentleman
in New Jersey, a few weeks since, travelled
fifty miles in four hours and a half. A gentleman
residing in 22d Street, New York, goes down town
to his business on his velocipede in twelve minutes.
Adepts abroad find no difficulty whatever in accomplishing
fully fifty miles in five hours, without once
alighting from their vehicles. A few months ago, a
couple of amateurs, making a tour through a part of
France, challenged each other as to which could perform
the greatest distance in four and twenty hours.
One accomplished eighty-seven miles, the other one
hundred and twenty-three. A party of nine quitted
Rouen early in the morning on their velocipedes,
and arrived in Paris in time for dinner the same
evening; having performed the distance of eighty-five
miles, exclusive of stoppages, and at a rate of
speed averaging between ten and twelve miles an
hour. An English gentleman travelled the distance
from London to Bristol, one hundred and thirty-five
miles, between the hours of three o’clock, <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>, one
day, and ten <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span> the next, stopping some hours in
Reading.</p>

<p>In Paris, the Americans carry off the prizes for
slow as well as fast riding. The slow riding is much
the more difficult. It is much easier for the rider to
keep his equilibrium while riding swiftly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes once published an article
in the “Atlantic Monthly,” entitled “The Human
Wheel; its Spokes and Felloes;” in which he treated
the act of walking as analagous to the movement
of a wheel: the legs being the spokes and the feet
the felloes. Had he postponed his humorous and
instructive essay a year or two, he would have found
himself behind the age.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not generally known to what an extent
the bicycle mania prevails, and how rapidly the
idea has germinated, budded, and bloomed, not only
throughout our own country, but in various parts of
the world. In New York some ten thousand pupils
are ready to graduate from the schools and appear
upon the roads. In Boston there will soon be nearly
as many more; while Philadelphia, Chicago, St.
Louis, and San Francisco count their experts by the
hundred and their novices by the thousand. We
hear of the bicycle in the far West and in Texas.
We read that New Orleans proposes to purchase
velocipedes for its fire companies, and hear of a
velocipede military company in Louisville. We
play velocipede music, and in our walks velocipede
“Livery Stables” and “Velocipedes to Let,” greet
our eyes. The shop-windows on our fashionable
thoroughfares display Velocipede Hats, Velocipede
Gloves, and Velocipede Shoes.</p>

<p>The machines have become so numerous on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
sidewalks of Providence, New Bedford, and other
New England towns, that the stunned authorities
contemplated prohibiting their use, as a nuisance.
The various merits of various machines are discussed
on the street corners with as much zeal as
were ever the diversified merits of horse-flesh; and
experts are to be heard talking of these new substitutes
for legs as jockeys are wont to talk of the
wind, strength, bottom, gait, and “go” of Eclipses,
Dexters, and Ethan Allens.</p>

<p>In France, fashion writers and fashion leaders
rack their brains for the contrivance of velocipede
costumes; velocipede clubs are formed; velocipede
championships contested for at velocipede tournaments.
There are not less than ten thousand
machines running in the streets of Paris. They are
used by postmen, government employees, students,
messengers, and peddlers; and shopmen send their
clerks about on machines covered with flashy advertisements.
All velocipedes there are required to carry
lanterns in the evening, and though we have no such
regulations here, young gentlemen may be seen almost
every night, in our cities, riding their velocipedes
with head-lights attached.</p>

<p>In Paris they can be seen driving at break-neck
speed along the narrow stone parapet beside the
Seine, and even down the hundred steps of the Trocadéro,
their riders all the time indulging in gymnastic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
feats that would seem to invite certain destruction.
At Rome, gentlemen practice the bicycle in the court-yards,
and are seen riding on the Piazza de Spagna.
Country trips are taken upon them in Japan, and
they are no longer a novelty in the streets of the
larger Chinese cities.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PATENTS_AND_THE_RIGHTS_OF_MANUFACTURERS">PATENTS AND THE RIGHTS OF MANUFACTURERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Early in last winter, a great rivalry began to develop
itself in the business of manufacturing velocipedes;
and the demand became so large, as to lead
the principal carriage-makers of the country into
making it an important branch of their business.
At that time it was generally understood that any
manufacturer was at liberty to make the two-wheeled
velocipede, in any way he deemed most profitable.</p>

<p>When the <i>furore</i> first manifested itself, Mr. Calvin
Witty of Broadway, New York, saw it would be
a “big thing,” and very quietly went to work to
find out in what way the business of making the
machine could be controlled. He ascertained, by
careful investigation, that a patent had been recorded,
covering the principal features of the bicycle,
now in such popular use. He sought out the owners
of the patent, found them in moderate circumstances,
eager to turn to account rights which had heretofore
been of but little avail, and purchased of them for a
comparatively small sum. He now claims to hold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
the right to the exclusive use of the two-wheeled
velocipede, with treadle and guiding arms. This
patent, however, does not cover the idea of making
a two-wheeled machine, or of applying a propelling
power.</p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Witty had completed his arrangements,
he ascertained the names of parties engaged
in manufacturing velocipedes throughout the country,
and the majority of them were the astonished
recipients of the following notification:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">No. 638 Broadway, N. Y.</span>, <i>Feb. 3d, 1869</i>.<br />
</p>

<p>“You are hereby notified, that Letter Patent No. 59,915,
granted Nov. 20th, 1866, secures a velocipede with the
two wheels, treadle, and guiding arms; and that the velocipede
you are manufacturing is an infringement upon said
patent. The present is to require you to cease the further
manufacture of said velocipede, and to settle with me for
all past infringements of the rights under said patent.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) &emsp; “<span class="allsmcap">CALVIN WITTY.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>The following is a copy of the record of the patent,
registered at the Patent Office in Washington:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Patent No. 59,915. Pierre Lallement, Paris, France,
assignor to himself and James Carroll, New Haven, Conn.
Velocipede. Nov. 20th, 1866.</p>

<p>“The fore wheel is axled in the jaws of a depending
bar which is riveted in the frame, and turned by a horizontal
lever bar. This wheel is revolved by a treadle crank.<br />
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
Claim: The combination and arrangement of the two
wheels, provided with the treadles and the guiding arms,
so as to operate substantially, and for the purpose, herein
set forth.”</p>
</div>

<p>Some manufacturers were nonplused by Mr. Witty’s
warning, and stopped their work entirely. Others
paid no attention to the demand, considering the
royalty required worthy of a trial; for if it could be
proved that a similarly constructed velocipede had
been introduced into the country before the date of
application, the inventor being an alien, the patent
would be void; or it would be rendered null also, if
the patentee had neglected to put into market and
continue the sale of the invention, within eighteen
months after the date of patent. Others still, including
most of the carriage-makers and machinists of
note in the country, who had gone into this business,
took pains to have legal advice upon the subject. A
meeting was finally held by them; and the result was
a determination to purchase State and city rights, for
the use of his patent, of Mr. Witty.</p>

<p>We give the names of the prominent firms and parties
who have received licenses for the manufacture
and sale of velocipedes, under Patent No. 59,915:&mdash;</p>

<p>Wm. P. Sargent &amp; Co., and John P. Whittier, Boston,
Mass., Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire,
excepting the cities of New Bedford, Taunton,
Fall River, and Fair Haven, Mass.; Kimball Bros.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
Boston, for the State of Maine; Wood Bros., Connecticut,
excepting one shop right; Pickering &amp; Davis,
New York City, one shop right; Mercer &amp; Monod,
New York City, one shop right; C. Merrill and
Sons, Brooklyn, one shop right. G. L. Brownell,
New Bedford, Mass., New Bedford exclusive; G. C.
Elliott, Providence, R. I., Rhode Island exclusive.
J. M. Quimby, Newark, N. J., New Jersey exclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. Witty now has his hands full of business;
employs three clerks to write for him constantly, and
has fallen upon a mine of wealth, if he succeeds in
maintaining the validity of his claim. He charges
the manufacturers ten dollars apiece, royalty, for
every machine turned out. If a maker, however,
obtains a license to manufacture less than a hundred,
he pays fifteen dollars royalty; if under twenty,
twenty-five dollars apiece.</p>

<p>Sargent and Whittier, of Boston, and many others
of the manufacturers, who have purchased State
and town rights, have sent out within their limits
circulars similar to those of Mr. Witty, but with the
following N. B. attached:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those using the two-wheeled velocipedes, not
manufactured under a license, and not having the
proper stamp, are also liable for infringement upon

<p>We present an engraving taken from the Patent
Office Reports, showing the Lallement patent of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
1866. In this <i>veloce</i> the cranks, F, are points of
great interest, as the claim is for the combination of
these treadle cranks with the two wheels A and B,
reach C, guiding arms D, and the fork in which the
front wheel is hung. We attribute the unpopularity
of the old dandy-horse to its lack of these cranks,
while the great success of the modern <i>veloce</i> is due
to the crank application. In this <i>veloce</i> it will be
noticed that the reach, C, extends over the rear
wheel, and a V brace on each side of the wheel connects
the axle to the reach. With this style of reach
or frame, it was found very difficult to construct a
<i>veloce</i> sufficiently steady to run with any degree of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>There is still another New York patentee, Stephen
W. Smith, who claims that the so-called French
Velocipede is an American invention, perfected in
this country, and introduced into France by patent,
and personally by himself; and that the idea was
stolen from him by the French manufacturers. He
obtained his patent in 1862, for a “cantering propeller”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
for children, or hobby-horse mounted on
wheels; and considers his patent to include the combinations
used upon all velocipedes, and threatens to
prosecute infringements.</p>

<p>This patent has lately been reissued for the purpose
of widening the claims and to attempt to cover
the whole ground occupied by the patent bicycle of
M. Lallement. The reissued claim is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“1st claim, in combination with a saddle-seat for the
rider, the employment and use of a cranked axle, arms,
and foot-rest, so arranged that the power applied by the
feet of the rider shall give motion to the vehicle, substantially
as described and specified.</p>

<p>“2. The combination of the following elements, namely,
a saddle-seat for the rider, a cranked axle, for propelling
the vehicle by power applied by the feet of the rider, and
a steering mechanism so constructed that the direction of
travel of the vehicle may be governed by the rider, substantially
as described and specified.</p>

<p>“3. The universal joint, in combination with the fulcrum
of the vehicle, and the steering wheel, constructed and
operating substantially as, and for, the purposes specified.</p>

<p>“4. The hinged legs in combination with the body of the
horse, and with the cranks substantially as and for the
purposes specified.</p>

<p>“5. The foot-rests upon the arms, substantially as and for
the purposes specified.</p>

<p>“6. The double-armed levers, and diagonal cords, in combination
with the handle and steering wheel, substantially
as described and specified.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>The first and second claims are intended to embrace,
and do embrace, as far as words can accomplish
it, the essential elements of the velocipede now
in use. It remains to be determined by the courts
how far the rival claimants clash with each other.
The manufacturers have as yet paid but very little
attention to the demands of Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>In 1867, the Hanlon Brothers devised an improved
style of reach, consisting of a bifurcated bar, or fork,
in the jaws of which the hind wheel is allowed to
revolve; while the single end of this fork forms part
of the swivel, over the front wheel. Not yet satisfied
with this <i>veloce</i>, on account of the difficulty they
found in using the same machine for their in-door
performances, and out-door exhibitions, they had the
saddle arranged so as to be enabled to vary its position
nearer to, or farther from, the front wheel, and
at the same time had slots made in the cranks, so
that the treadle might be adjusted to various lengths.
The alterations were found to be of such benefit,
that application for a patent covering these improvements
was made by them, and granted by the Patent
Office. We know of no velocipedes now being
made in this country, which do not include in their
construction all these late improvements, and the
Hanlons are also notifying manufacturers of the existence
of their claims.</p>

<p>The Patent powers in Washington are literally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
overwhelmed with applications for patents of different
models of these articles. In a large room in the
Patent Office, there are some four hundred of these
models awaiting investigation. Over eighty models
have already been examined and patents for them
issued; others are now under examination. Some
hundred caveats or notices that patents will be applied
for have been lately filed. In one week eighty
applications and caveats were received. One single
agency in New York city has lately prepared seventy
patents for improvements.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="HINTS_TO_PURCHASERS">HINTS TO PURCHASERS.</h2>
</div>

<p>There is a very general complaint of the high
prices maintained by the manufacturers of velocipedes,
and it is claimed that they are pocketing
immense receipts, at the expense of an excited and
incautious public. Though there is no doubt that
they can be manufactured at prices much below
those at which the best machines are now held, and
still yield a handsome profit, a reduction in price
will not be probable so long as the demand so far
exceeds the supply. And now that it is found that
the machine is patented, we will not have the so
much wished for cheap velocipede, which would
assuredly have followed the competition that had
commenced, before it was known that one man only
held the exclusive right to their manufacture.</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that as long as
materials and labor are so dear, the cost of manufacture
must necessarily be great. A manufacturer
requires draughtsmen to design his improvements,
pattern-makers to prepare models for the foundry,
blacksmiths to do the forging, wheelwrights for the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
wheels, machinists to turn and fit the work, foundry-men
to cast the pedals and braces, bolt-makers to
make the rivets and bolts, saddlers to prepare the
seats, and painters and varnishers to finish the
machine for the wareroom. The wear and tear in
the ordinary use of the velocipede is so great as to
require the very best of material in its construction.
There is no other kind of vehicle which receives
such severe usage. The weight of the rider and the
concussions of the road are not only borne by two
wheels, but the necessity of giving the fore wheel
a sidewise motion, render it indispensable to connect
the two by a frame, whose peculiar form and
character make it exceedingly liable to be deranged
and broken. This frame and its appendages must
be of wrought iron, steel, and brass, and all its work
must be of the best quality, or else the machine will
soon get out of order and become useless. The fittings
of the two wheels, their axles and their journals,
must also be of the best workmanship. The
same is true of the wheels themselves. No wood
that is not perfectly seasoned should be used for
them; and the hubs, spokes, and felloes must be
built with the utmost care and thoroughness; otherwise
they will soon become wabbling and unsteady,
so that speed and comfort will be out of the question.</p>

<p>The price of a good machine will not fall much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
below a hundred dollars, until there is a general
decline in the price of all sorts of commodities.</p>

<p>We advise the purchaser, by all means, to get a
<i>good machine</i>. It is now possible to buy cheap
velocipedes; and they will, no doubt, be manufactured
much cheaper, and yet be dear at any price.
The best are none too good, and are certainly worth
more than the difference.</p>

<p>The hall velocipedes are, for the most part, slim
affairs; the frame made entirely of cast iron, without
metal gearings, brakes, or springs, and useful only
for floors. It is uncomfortable for the rider to
go over roughnesses without springs, and a well-built
machine is required to stand the jar of uneven
roads.</p>

<p>It is no better policy to purchase a cheap velocipede,
than a cheap ready-made shoe or other article
of clothing.</p>

<p>It is a prevalent but erroneous idea, that the
larger the bicycle, the greater the beauty and the
greater the speed. A machine with a front wheel
of a diameter of forty inches, is the largest that
can possibly be rendered practicable. Thirty-eight
inches is much better; and good riders prefer that
of but thirty-six or thirty-seven inches diameter for
the road.</p>

<p>Before purchasing any machine, especially the
cheaper ones, examine them thoroughly; or if not a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
judge of good mechanical workmanship, ask a
friend to do it for you. Many defects are concealed
by the coatings of paint, particularly in the castings
and forgings; and a machine that is weak in any
point, is a dangerous one in fast riding. Be sure
that every bolt is properly secured by nuts that
cannot be shaken off; they should be riveted into the
bolt, as they will soon work loose if not so fastened.
The crank should never be keyed into the shaft, but
fastened on to a square head; or, what is better,
shrunk into the shaft.</p>

<p>The ingenious way of supporting lanterns on the
machine, is a waste of time and expense; better
some kind of clamps to secure a light umbrella in
front, when the sun shines hot, or it rains; and
clamps for fastening a travelling bag or shawl in the
rear, particularly if one looks forward to country excursions
and summer trips.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ADVICE_TO_THE_BEGINNER">ADVICE TO THE BEGINNER.</h2>
</div>

<p>To those who have never seen the two-wheeled
velocipede in use, it seems surprising that the rider
can keep his equilibrium. The principle of the thing
is the same as that of the movement of a boy’s hoop.
As long as the hoop revolves rapidly, its tendency to
any lateral movement is almost suspended, and the
greater the speed the less the difficulty in maintaining
the upright position.</p>

<p>At first sight one supposes it to be a formidable
undertaking to mount and steer the bicycle. To
learn to manage it, however, requires no more skill,
courage, or patience, than to learn the art of skating;
and when the art is once acquired, it provides a
means of locomotion and a source of enjoyment as
much more available than skating, as the number of
days in the year is greater than the few bright mornings
when one can find a smooth, glassy, and well-frozen
skating ground.</p>

<p>“Velocipedestrianism” is fully the equal of skating
and horseback riding, in its invigorating and
exhilarating effects. The velocipede bears young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and old, light and heavy, easily and pleasantly and
with equal facility.</p>

<p>In learning the velocipede, it is advisable to use a
machine of only moderate height, so that the soles
of the feet can readily touch the ground. At the
best school we know, where the pupils graduate experts,
six different sizes of machines are used. The
beginner is put upon one with a guiding wheel of
a diameter of only thirty-four inches, and is promoted
from one to another, according to progress.</p>

<p>At first start, run beside the iron horse, leading it
by the hand, so as to familiarize yourself with its
movements, and to master well in your mind the idea
of the fore wheel, upon which all depends. This will
be an affair of but a few moments only. You will
very readily perceive that it will be impossible to
balance upon the machine, while it is standing
still. You will also see that, without practice,
it will be an impossibility to mount the iron horse,
and balance yourself upon the seat, while it is in
motion. Both these facts lead you to perceive that
motion is the first requisite. To get that, and at the
same time maintain equilibrium, you must first use
your feet on the floor or ground as a means of progression,
learning, as you move, to balance yourself
by the motion of the guide wheel, to the right or left,
whichever way you may lean.</p>

<p>If out-of-doors, it is as well to practice on a slope;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
and after mounting, let the machine move forward
of its own accord, while you occupy yourself studying
the effect produced by the inclination which you
give to the balancing pole or handle. After you
have practiced enough to admit of your going some
little way without touching your feet, learn to go the
same distance with your legs raised, so as to bring
the centre of gravity higher from the base. When
you have overcome this difficulty and thoroughly understand
the action of the balancing pole, place one
foot on the pedal, and follow its movements, without
assisting them. Then try the other foot, and accustom
yourself to the movement of turning the wheels
with your feet. Next, put both feet upon the pedals,
and work them alternately with scrupulous regularity.
Speed is attained by simply accelerating
this movement. You will be surprised to find that
you can, all at once, ride your velocipede. After a
couple of hours of proper practice, you will be able
to accomplish a distance of thirty or forty yards,
without running the risk of an upset.</p>

<p>In learning, be careful to keep the shoulders straight
and the head back. An erect position upon the bicycle
is as necessary for grace and ease, as upon the
horse. Avoid looking at the wheels, but accustom
yourself to look ahead.</p>

<p>Confidence in your own ability is required, without
rashness. If you practice in a public hall, pay no
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
attention to the laughter of spectators, and avoid
self-consciousness. If you feel that no one was ever
so clumsy before, the feeling itself will be sure to
increase your awkwardness. Remember that all
good riders have necessarily been through the same
experience. It is no disgrace to upset your vehicle.
Molière says: “<i>On peut être honnête homme et faire
mal des vers.</i>”</p>

<p>Take things as easy as possible. The greatest
difficulty with beginners is to restrain the unnecessary
expenditure of muscular power. They ordinarily
perform ten times the amount of labor requisite.
They use all the force they can, in pressing upon the
pedals, and clasp the handle in front, as if hanging
on for dear life. Do not strain the muscles of the
arms. There is no necessity for it, or for any violent
muscular effort. A good rider can obtain the
greatest speed upon the road with half the exertion
used by the novice in learning the first movements.</p>

<p>If the day after your first attempt you feel a little
lame and sore, remember that it is nothing more than
you would feel after riding horseback for the first
time, or after taking gentle but unaccustomed exercise
in a gymnasium.</p>

<p>If you finish your first trial covered with dust and
perspiration, with a bumped head, jammed feet,
tired arms, and sore muscles, let your faith remain
triumphant, and your determination and expectation
to master the vehicle increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
But with proper caution there is no danger either
of falls or hurt in using the velocipede in the way we
have advised. The pedal is constructed so that the
foot of the rider can at once leave it; and should the
machine incline to one side, it is only necessary to
remove the foot from the same side, and place it on
the ground. One must not let the handles go; they
seem to restore and maintain the balance of the
machine after the rider is off it. In alighting, both
feet should be raised from the pedal at the same instant,
which slackens the speed of the machine, and
placed upon the ground simultaneously.</p>

<p>If you learn in a school or rink, you will find a
rough pine floor much the best for practice. Floors
that are sprinkled with sawdust, or sanded, are apt
to cause the machine to slip in turning.</p>

<p>In your first practice, avoid trying experiments, or
doing too much; but watch your position in the
saddle, and perfect yourself in the balance movement.
After that is perfectly learned, try to ride
slowly, and practice with your feet upon the rest in
front. It will of course require much experience before
you are able to dash along the paved streets or
country roads, or to try the tricks and fancy movements
of an expert. Perseverance, however, makes
perfect; and if you persist, you will be able, in due
time, to ride side-saddle fashion, to pick up your hat
from the floor, to take off your coat while going at
full speed, and even to stand upon the saddle.
</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
Some learn to ride in three hours, some in three
days, and occasionally we hear of a timid and stupid
scholar, for whom three months will scarcely suffice.
It depends upon the machine, the method of going
to work, and the quickness and adaptability of the
rider. The knowledge often comes suddenly. We
have seen those who have tried to learn for days
without success, suddenly mount their veloces and
start around a hall, astonished at the ease with which
they maintained their balance, and looking as pleased
as if they had accomplished the object of their existence.
A few hours’ practice usually makes a student
quite the master of ceremonies.</p>

<p>As soon as you have acquired the knowledge, you
will wonder how amateurs can be so awkward, and
be surprised that you found it so difficult.</p>

<p>Should the velocipede upon which you learn be
too high to practice in the way we have indicated,
you should have some one hold the machine for the
first trial, the hands upon the back extremity of the
bar upon which you sit, so as to in no way impede
the action of the fore wheel.</p>

<p>To those who wish to learn, we would especially
suggest the spring, fall, and winter months. It is
too warm to learn in summer, that being the season
to reap the reward of early exertion. Velocipede
riding is the easiest thing imaginable when one
knows how to ride properly.</p>

A is the front wheel. This is the steering wheel,
and upon its axis the power is applied. B is the
hind wheel; C, the treadles or foot-pieces; D, the
treadle cranks; E, slots in cranks, by which to adjust
the foot-pieces and accommodate the length to the
legs of the rider; F, bifurcated jaw, the lower part
of which forms the bearing for the axle of the front
wheel. From the upper part of this jaw a rod or
pivot extends, to which is attached the steering arm
or handle F; G, the reach or perch, extending from
the jaw of the front wheel to the rear or hind wheel.
This reach is bifurcated, forming jaws for the hind
wheel. H, “rests” on the front part of the reach.
The rider puts one leg on the rest and works one of
the cranks with the other leg while riding “side-saddle,”
or a leg may be placed upon each rest when
the velocipede has acquired sufficient momentum,
and the rider does not wish to keep his feet upon
the treadles. I, the saddle or seat, which is adjustable
on the seat-spring L, by the thumb-screw K.
The seat-spring L, is attached at M to the reach G,
which, at the other end, is fastened to the spring-struts
N, that rise from the reach G; O, the brake-lever,
on the fulcrum P; Q, the “shoe” of the brake
that acts against the periphery of the hind wheel.
The brake is operated by means of the cord S, one
end of which is attached to the steering handle F,
and the other end to the reach at 3. A cord passes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
from the steering handle under the pulley or roller 4,
thence over the pulley 5, on the brake-lever O, and
from there to the point 3, where it is attached to the
reach G. The brake is operated by giving a slight
turning motion to the handle F, thus winding a
small sheave upon the axis of the handle, and bringing
the shoe Q, of the brake-lever O, in contact with
the surface of the wheel B.</p>

<p>The best two-wheeled velocipedes manufactured in
this country, are those of Messrs. Pickering &amp; Davis,
Wood Brothers, Mercer &amp; Monod, and Calvin
Witty, New York City; and William P. Sargent
&amp; Co., and Kimball Brothers, Boston, Mass.</p>

<h3 id="WOOD_BROTHERS_VELOCIPEDE">WOOD BROTHERS’ VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>The Wood Brothers, of 596 Broadway, New
York, decided at the commencement of the <i>furore</i>
in this country, to make the manufacture of velocipedes
an important branch of their business. They
made thorough and personal investigation of the
many styles used abroad, and selected the patents of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Messrs. Michaux &amp; Co., as being the one most in
favor with experts there.</p>

<p>The Wood Brothers’ velocipede, though very similar
to the French machine, is made of better material,
with steel tires and axles, and with gun-metal
gearings upon the rear wheel. This machine combines
in a great degree lightness and durability. It
weighs from fifty to fifty-eight pounds, and if required,
can easily be led, lifted, or even carried by
the rider. The seat is fixed more directly over the
stirrups than in some machines, and at such a height
above the wheels as to avoid wear and tear of the
clothing from contact with mud and dirt, and the
driving wheel in turning. The stirrups are attached
in such a manner to the crank, that they can be adjusted
near the hub or axle, giving speed on level
roads; or they can be placed at the end of the
crank, giving power and ease for rough roads and
ascending grades. Two kinds of stirrups are used;
the “spool pattern,” entirely round, and covered with
leather, making it easy for the beginner to keep his
foot in place; and the French swing stirrup, which is
for proficient riders and general use. This latter
style has a very long bearing, relieving the strain on
the ankle joint, and making it easy to ride a distance
without fatigue.</p>

<p>This bicycle has a brake, rests for the feet in front,
and a handsomely finished saddle, supported by steel
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
springs. It will ascend a grade of one foot in
twenty. The price is $135.</p>

<p>The Wood Brothers have in their possession the
first velocipede ever brought into this country.
When first exhibited on the sidewalk in front of their
warerooms, it attracted such attention that the
police requested them to remove it. They have just
completed for a New York gentleman, at a price of
$300, one of the most completely finished velocipedes
yet manufactured in America.</p>

<h3 id="THE_MONOD_VELOCIPEDE">THE MONOD VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>Messrs. Mercer &amp; Monod, of 54 William Street,
New York, manufacture their velocipedes after a
model of their own, which has its advantages, and
embraces many of the best points of the French
machine.</p>

<p>The steering post is inclined backward, which
brings the handle within easy reach of the body, and
the whole machine under perfect control; and gives
it a particularly rakish and natty appearance upon
the road. The saddle can be adjusted backward or
forward, according to the length of limb of the rider.</p>

<p>Messrs. Mercer &amp; Monod use the triangular beveled
treadle and an improved brake. The defect of
this machine is its weight, which is about seventy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
pounds. Some riders, however, prefer a heavier
machine than others, and recommend the Monod
velocipede on this account.</p>

<p>A good rider on this machine can obtain a speed
of ten or twelve miles an hour. It varies in price
from $110 to $150, according to finish.</p>

<p>These gentlemen have lately manufactured some
very complete machines for country use, with shawl
rack, mud dasher, etc.</p>

<h3 id="WITTYS_VELOCIPEDE">WITTY’S VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>Calvin Witty, of 638 Broadway, New York, models
his velocipedes almost entirely after those of
Messrs. Michaux &amp; Co. When he commenced their
manufacture, he tried by various experiments to improve
upon the original patent. Most of his attempts
proved unsuccessful. Among other proposed improvements,
he endeavored to apply the brake to the
front wheel, but found that it would stop the machine
on the instant, and throw the rider headlong; and
that such a brake, though suitable for a steam-engine,
could not be rendered practicable upon a velocipede.</p>

<p>These machines are made of wrought iron, with
brakes, springs, improved saddle, and gun-metal
bearings. As Mr. Witty has the exclusive right of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
M. Lallement’s patent upon the two-wheeled velocipede,
he can afford to manufacture at a somewhat
cheaper rate than those who are obliged to pay a
royalty. His bicycles range in price from $90 to $130.</p>

<p>Mr. Witty’s first machines were not so good as
some of other manufacturers, but he has lately improved
upon them. They are a little heavier than
those of Messrs. Sargent &amp; Co., Pickering &amp; Davis,
and Wood Brothers, but equal to any in durability
and finish.</p>

<p>Mr. Witty is at present constructing a velocipede
which he anticipates will run a mile in one minute
and twenty seconds, or faster than any trotting-horse
can ever be expected to go; the driving wheel is to
be so constructed that it will revolve three times
while the treadles are once making their circuit.</p>

<p>As will be seen from the accompanying engraving,
“Pickering’s American Velocipede,” manufactured

New York, differs very materially from the French
model, so generally used by other manufacturers. It

and stronger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>

<p>The reach or frame of this velocipede is made of
hydraulic tubing. The gun-metal bearings are so
attached that, when worn, they may be replaced by
others, which are interchangeable like the parts of
sewing-machines and fire-arms. The axle is so constructed
as to constitute, in itself, an oil box. It is
made tubular, and closed at either end with a screw,
on the removal of which it is filled with lard oil.
Cotton lamp-wick is placed loosely in the tubular
axle and the oil is by this means fed to the bearing,
as fast as required, through the small holes made for
the purpose in the centre of the axle. The saddle
is supported on a spiral spring, giving an elastic seat;
it is brought well back, so that the rider maintains
an erect position, and is adjustable to suit the length
of limb of the rider. The tiller or steering handle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
is constructed with a spring, so that the hands are
relieved from the jolting that they would otherwise
receive while running over rough ground. The stirrups
or crank pedals, are three-sided, with circular
flanges at each end, fitted to turn on the crank pins,
so that the pressure of the foot will always bring one
of the three sides into proper position. They are so
shaped as to allow of the use of the fore part of the
foot, bringing the ankle joint into play, relieving the
knee, and rendering propulsion easier than when
the shank of the foot alone is used. The connecting
apparatus differs from that of the French vehicle in
that the saddle bar serves only as a seat and brake,
and is not attached to the rear wheel. By a simple
pressure forward against the tiller, and a backward
pressure against the tail of the saddle, the saddle
spring is compressed, and the brake attached to it
brought firmly down against the wheel.</p>

<p>Messrs. Pickering &amp; Davis have a large manufactory,
and are the constant recipients of orders
from all parts of the country. Mr. Pickering has
always been a practical machinist, and personally
superintends the structure of each machine turned
out.</p>

<p>A rider upon the Pickering velocipede can average
ten or twelve miles an hour. On good roads they
have been ridden, for short distances, at the rate of
eighteen miles an hour. It is claimed that they will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
easily ascend a grade of from one foot in twenty to
one in fifteen.</p>

<p>The price varies from $110 to $155. A very complete,
finely finished one, can be bought for $150.
This is an expensive machine; but many <i>connoisseurs</i>
think its advantages over other bicycles fully
merit the small difference in price. Many experts
use it altogether for fancy riding, and many who
have tried all kinds upon the road, think this much
to be preferred.</p>

<h3 id="SARGENT_VELOCIPEDE">SARGENT VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>Wm. P. Sargent &amp; Co., of 155 Tremont Street,
Boston, have many excellent facilities, in connection
with their extensive works for the construction of
pleasure carriages, for the manufacture of velocipedes.
They foresaw the <i>furore</i> that would arise in
this country before its commencement, and made
early preparations to engage largely in the manufacture
of the Parisian novelty.</p>

<p>Their machines are made upon the French plan,
with all the American improvements, in form, material,
and thoroughness of construction. They are
very similar to those made by the Wood Brothers,
but have important merits of their own. The hind
wheel turns on the axle bar, preventing the friction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
upon the bearing, as in other machines in which the
axle turns with the wheel. The neck of the machine
is wrought in one piece, and the head of the swivel
in the neck is of wrought iron, square in shape.
The fork of the steering bar is of wrought iron also,
instead of the cast brass usually used. This makes
a delicate part of the machine very durable, for it is
a rule in mechanics that one metal will act upon
itself with less friction than upon another kind of
metal. The best workmen are employed and the
best material used. The tires and axles are of the
finest steel, and the bearings of the finest gun-metal.
The saddle is adjustable and can be readily moved
backward or forward.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sargent &amp; Co. use both the three-sided
beveled and the swing treadle, either of which always
present a surface to the foot, so that after mounting
or removing the foot temporarily, no time is lost in
replacing it.</p>

<p>They have made every effort to construct a light,
noiseless, steady-running, completely-finished, and
perfect machine. Their price is from $110 to $150.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sargent &amp; Co. also manufacture a cheaper
machine, without springs, much like those manufactured
by Mr. Brownell of New Bedford. This
machine is sold for $55, and is used with satisfaction
in halls and rinks.</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent has on hand in his warerooms a large
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
assortment of machines of other manufacturers, including
those of Wood Brothers, Mercer &amp; Monod,
and Pickering &amp; Davis.</p>

<h3 id="KIMBALLS_VELOCIPEDE">KIMBALL’S VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>Messrs. Kimball Brothers &amp; Co., of 110, 112, and
114 Sudbury Street, Boston, secured the first license
granted in this country under the Lallement patent,
giving them the exclusive right to manufacture in
Maine, and the liberty of selling throughout the
United States. They have long enjoyed a high reputation
for elegant sleighs and carriages, and at their
commencement of the manufacture of velocipedes,
determined to maintain their reputation in this new
and important branch of their business. Their velocipedes
are also patterned from those of Messrs.
Michaux &amp; Co., with such improvements as are in
use with the best manufacturers.</p>

<p>The frames of these machines are of wrought iron
and steel, with composition and gun-metal bearings,
steel levers, and axles, and superior saddles. Even
into the lowest priced machines, they put the best
stock in every part. Messrs. Kimball Brothers’
velocipedes vary in price from $75 to $175, according
to style and finish. The most expensive are furnished
with mud fenders, lamps, and silver-plated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
brakes. A very fine one can be obtained for $135.
Their cheaper bicycles are, without doubt, as good
as any in the market. They are light, durable, built
of wrought iron, and <i>furnished with springs</i>.</p>

<hr class="r65" />

<p>The New England manufacturers of two-wheeled
velocipedes, next in prominence to Messrs. Sargent
&amp; Kimball, are William H. Brownell &amp; Co., of New
Bedford, George E. Elliott, of Providence, and
Messrs. Dalzell &amp; Sons, of South Egremont.</p>

<p>William H. Brownell &amp; Co., of New Bedford,
manufacture only the cheaper kind of velocipedes.
The frame or reach, which curves over the rear
wheel, is built of wrought iron. The machine is
without springs or metal gearings. This is used
almost exclusively in the New England schools and
rinks; and for the use of the beginner, or on smooth
floors, gives merited satisfaction. It is not as suitable
for the road, or as easy for the rider, as the more
expensive machines, which are furnished with
springs, brakes, and rests for the feet. But for those
who wish to have a bicycle, with as small an expenditure
as possible, this machine will answer as well
as any that we know. It is firm and durable, moderately
light, and does not get easily out of repair.</p>

<p>Messrs. Brownell &amp; Co. have sold $40,000 worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
of machines in the last three months, and the demand
is far greater than the supply. They are as
heavily engaged in the business as any manufacturers
in the country. The price varies from $70 to
$90. A good machine of Mr. Brownell’s make can
be obtained for $75.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>George C. Elliott, of Providence, has purchased a
license under the Lallement patent, for the exclusive
manufacture of the two-wheeled velocipede in Rhode
Island. He combines the French machine with the
usual American improvements. The prices are the
same as are demanded for other good machines.</p>

<p>Those who have used Mr. Elliott’s bicycles claim
that they are the equal of any manufactured.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Messrs. Dalzell &amp; Sons, of South Egremont,
Massachusetts, manufacture a velocipede which has
many of the merits of that of the Wood Brothers.
Their velocipede works are at Hudson, N. Y., and
there is a steadily increasing demand for their
machines. The prices vary from $125 to $150.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>G. F. Perkins &amp; Co., of Haydenville, Mass., advertise
to furnish a velocipede with steel springs for
$40. We do not know that their machine has
been fairly tested. We have never seen it in use,
and are unable to speak of its merits.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
Among the latest improved machines, is one manufactured
by Messrs. Tomlinson, Demarest, &amp; Co.,
No. 620 Broadway, New York. It is called the
“Improved American Velocipede,” and differs from
styles best known to the public in important respects.
It is the recipient of many encomiums from
those who have learned to ride it.</p>

<p>The iron arms, between which the front wheel is
held, are inclined back at an angle of forty-five
degrees from the perpendicular, which inclination
brings the seat in such a relative position to the fore wheel,
that a man of medium height can, with his
feet, reach the treadles of one of these velocipedes,
the front wheel of which is forty-five inches in diameter,
with as much ease as he can those of the ordinary
velocipede, the fore wheel of which is of a
diameter seven or eight inches smaller. This peculiarity
gives likewise great facility in describing
sharp curves and circles of small diameter, the body
being inclined in the direction in which the rider
wishes to propel himself, and in the direction in
which the driving wheel is inclined. Those who
have become expert in the use of this new machine,
claim that the movement of the body in propelling
and guiding it, is more nearly analogous to that of
skating, than is employed in controlling the ordinary
bicycle. Indeed, they claim that it can be guided by
the mere inclination of the body without perceptibly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
varying the pressure upon the handles to the one
side or the other.</p>

<p>The peculiar rakish arrangement of the standard,
prevents the usual jar to the guiding arms in going
over rough ground and pavements, and allows the
wheel to turn without soiling the pantaloons. It is
claimed that this machine can be driven at great
speed, and up steep grades.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Messrs. Pearsall Brothers, of New York, have
patented a bicycle which is so constructed that the
rear wheel is used as a guiding wheel. This
machine will turn a quick corner, and can be ridden
rapidly. Its price is $125.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stephen W. Smith, of 90 William Street, New
York, manufactures a velocipede for boys, with a
guiding wheel twenty inches in diameter, for $25.
The saddle of this machine is so wide that but
little balancing power is requisite, and any child can
easily learn to ride it.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DEXTER_BICYCLE">THE DEXTER BICYCLE.</h3>

<p>The Dexter bicycle only differs from other two-wheeled
machines in one respect. This, however, is
quite important. By a simple and effective device,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
it admits of an instantaneous connection and
disconnection of the crank with the axle of the
driving wheel, keeping the treadles stationary or in
motion, at the will of the rider, while the wheel continues
to revolve. Ordinarily, in obtaining a high
rate of speed on a velocipede, the rapidity of the
revolution of the crank becomes too great to be followed
by the movement of the feet, except at the
expenditure of too much exertion. This difficulty is
wholly obviated by Mr. Dexter. A continuous and
uniform rate of speed may be kept up with his
machine without fatiguing the rider.</p>

<h3 id="THE_CHICAGO_VELOCIPEDE">THE CHICAGO VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>This velocipede is manufactured by Messrs.
Loring &amp; Keene, of Chicago, Illinois, and has become
very popular in that city and throughout the
West. It is a light machine, somewhat similar to
that of Pickering &amp; Davis. The saddle is upon a
spiral spring, is not connected with the rear wheel,
and serves as a seat and brake. The manufacturers
claim that it will ascend a grade of one foot in
eighteen, and that it can be driven at great speed.
Its price is $130.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
D. W. Gosling, of Cincinnati, Ohio, has been engaged
for some months in the manufacture of a
velocipede upon the Franco-American plan. He
claims that his bicycle is equal to any other, both in
durability and fine workmanship.</p>

<p>There is another manufactory in Cincinnati,
which turns out sixteen hundred velocipedes per week,
that are sold at $35 each. These machines are of
the poorest possible workmanship and material.</p>

<p>There are large numbers of bicycles in the market
which are both unsafe and dangerous, and which the
makers push into unsuspecting hands by offering
them at much reduced rates. Many portions of
these which should be of wrought iron, are made of
cast iron, of course attractively painted. Nothing
should be cast about the metal works of a velocipede
except the brasses.</p>

<p>A bad machine carefully kept, may, perhaps, last
longer than a good machine very badly managed.
It should be the ambition of a good rider, however,
to have a good machine, kept in good order. There
is danger to the velocipedist in pushing ahead with
speed, when the slightest collision, or the giving
way of some minute portion of the machine, may
smash the whole affair.</p>

FOUR-WHEELED VELOCIPEDES.</h2>

<h3 id="BRADFORDS_VELOCIPEDE">BRADFORD’S VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>If any of our readers desire the luxury of a ride
on a velocipede without the necessity of taking lessons,
or the danger of getting a fall, they will find
“Bradford’s Four-Wheeled Velocipede” ready and
able to afford them the pleasure.</p>

<p>The inventor of this vehicle, Mr. C. K. Bradford,
has devoted the greater part of the last five years to
experiments upon the velocipede, and took out his
first patent three years and a half ago. The
machine, as now constructed and improved, obtained
its American patent October 13th, 1868. It
has since been patented in England, France, and
Belgium. It is made of the best material, and
finished like a gentleman’s trotting wagon. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
weighs but sixty-five pounds, and combines in a
high degree both lightness and strength. Any man,
woman or child, can learn to guide it easily with
but a few moments practice.</p>

<p>The inventor claims that it is able to maintain a
speed of a mile in three minutes, and that the extraordinary
time of a half mile in one minute and
forty-five seconds, has been made upon a country
road. It can be driven by almost any man, at the
rate of a mile in four minutes, on almost any road,
without greater exertion than is ordinarily used in
walking. This velocipede, unlike all others, is seen
to best advantage on the street. In Mr. Bradford’s
tasteful little curricle, the rider can sit at ease as
carelessly as in a carriage, giving himself up wholly
to the exhilaration of the rapid movement, and the
pleasurable exercise of the muscles, which is just
enough to make the machine skim over the ground,
and give an enjoyable sense of power. The
increase of friction, which would naturally result
from the additional number of wheels, is prevented
by an application of anti-friction rollers, which reduce
the labor of propelling the machine to a minimum,
a requisite of the highest importance to a
person seeking either recreation or utility.</p>

<p>This velocipede has an adjustable seat, which may
be placed nearer or further from the pedal crank, to
suit the rider’s length of limb. The seat is furnished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
with a high, strong back, which, besides adding
materially to the rider’s comfort, serves him as a
<i>point d’appui</i>, a firm base from which he can exert
a powerful force in propelling.</p>

<p>The steering device is simple and complete, and
is the same principle upon which one guides the
horse. It is guided by the hands, and the large
rear wheels are operated upon by means of a wheel
and cord arrangement, conveniently placed beside
the seat. It is claimed that the machine can be
steered almost to a hair’s breadth. It is used by
many city firms for the purpose of carrying messages
and parcels, and can be seen upon Broadway
in the thickest part of the travel. It does not hesitate
at curb-stones, and will run over most roads as
easily as any light wagon. It can be ridden up
almost any hill without a fatiguing expenditure of
force. It offers excellent advantages for carrying
refreshments and various articles of light baggage,
necessary in a flying trip or excursion.</p>

<p>Though this machine requires more room for its
accommodation than the bicycle, and cannot be
stored against any wall; and though it does not give
the peculiar and fascinating kind of exhilaration
which balancing upon the bicycle affords, it will be
seen to have many advantages over the two-wheeled
vehicle.</p>

<p>This velocipede is especially adapted to ladies, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
allows the rider to sit as becomingly and gracefully
as she would in her carriage or her parlor chair.
The proprietors have a very ingenious device which
can be attached to the machine for ladies, which
completely conceals all points of motion.</p>

<p>The Bradford Brothers have a large manufactory
in Newark, N. J. Mr. J. W. Thorp is their agent,
and is rapidly selling State and county rights. This
velocipede is sold at $150.</p>

<p>The Messrs. Bradford also manufacture a smaller
size for boys, complete in every particular, for $75.</p>

<h3 id="CALLAHANS_VELOCIPEDE">CALLAHAN’S VELOCIPEDE.</h3>

<p>This velocipede was patented January 5th, 1869,
and is on exhibition at 17 State Street, Boston. It
has been thoroughly tested and is pronounced a
complete success. It will be seen that it is very
different from Bradford’s machine. The front wheels
are used as guiding wheels, the rear as the driving
ones. It is propelled by both hands and feet, acting
together or separately. The propelling power is
almost unlimited, and is furnished by cranks in the
hind axles, with lever attachments. It has three
different steering arrangements, either of which can
be applied, according to the taste of the purchaser.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
In all these, the forward wheel and axle are turned
with a lever arrangement, operated upon by the hand.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_068" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The machine develops both chest and limbs, and
can be readily used by ladies and children. A little
girl of six years has ridden it for an hour without
fatigue. It is so constructed, that scruples of delicacy
need prevent no lady from driving it. It can
be driven either backwards or forwards, will run upon
the road, at the rate of fifteen miles an hour, and will
ascend any ordinary hill with ease. It is claimed,
that it is the only machine made that can be checked
in going down hill, or that can be stopped instantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
The machine varies in size and weight. That
most in favor, has a wheel of three feet and a half in
diameter, and a weight of about one hundred pounds.
It is constructed of the best material, and is neat and
nobby in appearance. Its price is $125.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_TRICYCLE">THE TRICYCLE.</h2>
</div>

<p>The generic tricycle, or three-wheeled velocipede,
as used abroad, is not likely to meet with general
favor in this country.</p>

<p>In its steering arrangements and mode of propulsion,
its construction is similar to that of the bicycle.
The rear wheels are large and light; the fore wheel
is smaller, and serves to guide the machine, being
acted upon by means of the steering bar or handle,
which causes it to bend in the direction indicated by
the rider. The pedals are attached to the front wheel,
and are shaped like slippers, which facilitates the
movement of the legs, and at the same time admits
of the feet being disengaged simultaneously. The
movement required to propel this machine is a
natural one, does not produce unusual fatigue, and
is analogous to that of walking.</p>

<p>The larger three-wheeled velocipedes have a lever
which follows the line of the eccentrics attached to
the pedals, and fits on to the axles. By assisting the
movement of this lever, the speed of the vehicle is
considerably increased, and a simple pressure against
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
it checks the rotary motion of the wheel, and stops
the progress of the machine. This lever is, in fact,
both a means of impulsion and a brake. As this
vehicle is chiefly patronized by the fair sex, the seat
is more commodious than that of the bicycle; having
sides and back of wicker, and a horse-hair cushion.</p>

<p>The tricycle is simply a hack, while the bicycle is
a blooded horse that fully demonstrates the “poetry
of motion.” The tricycle is easier to guide, and
safer to ride than the two-wheeled machine; there is
however more friction, and its speed is much less
rapid. It has, thus far, been found impossible to
construct a three-wheeler with the pedal method of
propulsion, that could compete with the bicycle in
speed or pleasure of driving. Large wheels are
necessary for speed. If a guiding wheel be applied to
a tricycle of this kind large enough to run rapidly
on the road, and to counterbalance the size of the
other wheels, it would be unsteady of motion; the
rider would be apt to be thrown headlong at any jar,
and the whole machine would be rendered unsafe.</p>

<p>Many of the larger manufacturers have built the
tricycle to some extent. Most of them have discontinued
their make, finding it unprofitable, and
that the machine gave but little satisfaction.</p>

<p>The Bradford Brothers of New York City obtained
a patent, and entered largely into the business, at
considerable expense. They, however, soon stopped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
the manufacture, and gave exclusive attention to
their four-wheeled machines. The three-wheeled
velocipedes of Messrs. Kimball Brothers, Boston,
seem to be as popular as any in the market; but the
sale is mostly local, and but few of them are manufactured.</p>

<p>Various inventors have endeavored to obtain power,
by additions to the gearings, in the shape of spring
wheels and levers, but with little success. Others
have applied the principle of the crank to be turned
by the hand, using the hand for steering purposes.</p>

<p>Mr. Wm. H. Hall, of Boston, Mass., has invented
a tricycle, which is impelled by a crank, acting upon
a small wheel, connected to another by an endless
pulley. Every revolution of the crank turns the
wheels of the machine once. This machine has not
yet been fairly tested.</p>

<p>A mechanic in Indiana also claims to have invented
a machine very similar in construction to this of
Mr. Hall’s.</p>

<p>Messrs. Forbes &amp; Sears of New Bedford, Mass.,
have invented a machine with two hind wheels
running only about five inches apart. It is claimed
that the hind wheels are so near together as to run
practically as one wheel; and yet the rider can stop
the vehicle and maintain his equilibrium.</p>

<p>Messrs. Topliff &amp; Ely of Eleria, Ohio, patented
February 23d, 1869, a tricycle, in which, by a simple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
movement of a lever, the rear wheels can be run into
one, and the vehicle instantaneously changed into a
bicycle.</p>

<p>A gentleman of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., has invented
a machine, in which both the hind wheels are drivers
instead of the forward one. They are fastened on
independent axles meeting in the centre, connected
by a novel arrangement of gearing, so that either
wheel can stand as a pivotal point, and the other be
driven round it very swiftly. The inventor states
that it will turn in less space than any other velocipede.</p>

<p>Mr. John Tremper, of Wilmington, Del., has designed
and patented a tricycle in which the front
wheel is the driver as usual; but placed so closely to
the axle of the hind wheels, as to give almost as
complete command over the motions of the machine,
in turning corners, as the two-wheeled velocipede.</p>

<p>“The Bennet Velocipede” is characterized by a
driving wheel four feet in diameter, and two guiding
wheels behind, each about a foot in diameter.</p>

<p>“Samuels’ Velocipede” has also a large driving
wheel, with small guiding wheels behind. This
machine is propelled by hand cranks, connected with
corresponding cranks in the driving wheel shaft. The
feet are used for steering. The inventor claims that
this machine will run twenty-five miles an hour on a
level road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
A New Yorker has invented a machine for ladies,
which he has placed on exhibition at Pearsall Riding
School. The pedals are applied to the rear wheels,
and the small wheel in front is guided by a rod,
passing back to the hand of the lady occupying the
seat.</p>

<p>One or two of the novel tricycles, modeled upon
new principles, have proved decided successes.</p>

<p>A gentleman of Ypsilanti, Mich., has invented one
that he claims to have ridden from that place to
Detroit, a distance of twenty-eight miles, in two
hours and forty-eight minutes; and to have made a
mile in Ypsilanti in two minutes and thirty seconds.
The wheels of this machine are forty-two inches in
diameter, and are propelled by means of a double
hand crank, no treadles being used. On each side
of the hub of the forward wheel, is a grooved pulley;
and attached to the straight portion of the crank are
two more pulleys, the four being connected by belts.
At each revolution of the pulleys, the vehicle is propelled
a distance of sixteen and a half feet; and
when an ordinary rate of speed is attained, it runs
quite easily. Its weight is forty-nine pounds, and
the inventor claims that it will sustain two hundred
pounds without danger of collapsing. It can be run
on ordinary carriage roads, with comparative ease.</p>

<p>Samuel Marden of Newton Corner, Mass., has lately
commenced the manufacture of a three-wheeled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
velocipede for which he obtained a patent in February,
1868. He calls his machine “a mechanical horse;”
it is propelled <i>by the weight of the rider</i>, and by
friction. It has neither treadles, cranks, or guiding
arms. The rider rises in his stirrups as on a trotting
horse. The saddle is so arranged that the pressure
upon it revolves a gearing wheel, which acts upon a
small one connected with the axle of the rear wheel;
these wheels are thus made to turn very rapidly. It
will be seen that this velocipede is constructed upon
an entirely new principle. It is claimed that it can
be driven upon the road, at the rate of from ten to
fifteen miles an hour. This machine can be used by
ladies, with a side-saddle arrangement. Its price is
$125. Mr. Marden’s velocipede has been tested, and
we think he has a fortune in his invention. He has
more orders than he can fill, and is prepared to sell
State, county, and town rights.</p>

HEMMING’S UNICYCLE, OR “FLYING
YANKEE VELOCIPEDE.”</h2>
</div>

<p>The single-wheeled velocipede has at length received
a palpable body, and “a local habitation and
a name.”</p>

<p>Richard C. Hemming of New Haven, Conn., invented
the machine herewith represented, two years
ago; but has only recently brought it into the market
and applied it to practical purposes. The main
wheel has a double rim, or has two concentric rims,
the inner face of the inner one having a projecting
lip for keeping the friction rollers and the friction
driver in place; each of these being correspondingly
grooved on their peripheries. The frame on which
the rider sits, sustains these friction wheels in double
parallel arms, on the front one of which is mounted
a double pulley, with belts passing to small pulleys
on the axis of the driving wheel. This double wheel
is driven, as seen, by cranks turned by the hands.
The friction of the lower wheel on the surface of
the inner rim of the main wheel, is the immediate
means of propulsion. A small binding wheel, seen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
between the rider’s legs, serves to keep the bands or
belts tight. The steering is effected either by inclining
the body to one side or the other, or by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
foot impinging on the ground, the stirrups being
hung low for this purpose. By throwing the weight
on these stirrups, the binding wheel may be brought
more powerfully down on the belts. Over the rider’s
head is an awning, and there is also a shield in front
of his body to keep the clothes from being soiled by
mud and wet. When going forward, the driving
wheel is kept slightly forward of the centre of gravity
by the position of the rider. By this means the
power exerted is comparatively small. Every turn
of the crank is equivalent to a rotation of the great
wheel.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemming says that this machine can be
manufactured for fifty dollars, of a weight of only
thirty pounds; that it will ascend steep grades, and
that it can be driven on the roads with but little
exertion, at the rate of twenty or even twenty-five
miles an hour. This wheel is of a diameter of from
six to eight feet.</p>

<p>Mr. Hemming’s boy of thirteen has one five feet
in diameter, the first manufactured, crude in construction,
and heavier than necessary, which he propels
at the rate of a mile in three minutes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A mechanic of Dubuque, Iowa, has invented a
one-wheeled machine, which he calls a velocycle or
velocyde. This velocipede is not ridden upon, but
transports its rider into the position of “walkist.” It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
is a large wheel or double wheel, made a unit by a
light rim of five feet one inch in diameter. The
operator steps upon the rim and commences to ascend
an endless ladder. It being movable, of course he
does not ascend but sets the wheel in motion. The
inventor claims that the effort is not greater than the
force of muscle required in ordinary locomotion, and
that by his arrangement of pulleys, each step gives
a complete revolution of the wheel and is equivalent
to a stride of eighteen feet. He claims that it will
ascend steep grades, will run at the rate of twenty
miles an hour, will not weigh over twenty pounds,
and that it can be manufactured for $40.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The single wheeled velocipede was perhaps predicted
in Ezekiel i. 15-21. A gentleman in Pittsburg,
Pa., claims to have invented one, which can
be propelled by the combined force of five men,
who occupy comfortable seats in the automatic
horse. This wheel is ten feet in diameter, and the
inventor thinks it can be driven at the rate of twenty
miles an hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A New York mechanic has devised a monocycle
or single machine, which consists of a wheel eight
feet in diameter, with a tire six inches wide, or two
narrow tires on its outer edges, with two sets of
spokes connecting with a double centre, which fills
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
the place of a hub, the two sides of which are two
feet and a half apart. The operator is in the middle,
and propels the wheel by an apparatus, in which
both his weight and his muscles are brought into play.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp68" id="i_080" style="max-width: 20em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We present an engraving of an English one-wheeled
velocipede. The feet are placed on short
stilts, connected with the cranks, one on either side
of the rim, while the rider sits upon a steel spring
saddle over the whole wheel. The inventor modestly
limits the diameter of the wheel to twelve feet,
and the number of revolutions to fifty per minute.
Twenty-five miles per hour is the speed expected to
be reached. The riders of this machine, without the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
ability to overcome the laws of gravity, would be
very likely to get broken bones and noses. It is
not likely to come into general use.</p>

<hr class="r65" />

<p>Captain Du Boisson, a Frenchman and captain
of Prince Napoleon’s yacht, “Jerome Napoleon,” has
invented a velocipede which runs upon water with
great facility. It is composed of two parallel tubes
of cast iron, cigar-shaped, connected by iron cross-pieces.
In the centre is a propelling wheel, covered
by a house or drum, on the top of which the person
using the vessel sits comfortably in a sort of saddle,
with stirrups. By means of these stirrups and a
hand crank upon each side, he gives the wheel its
motion, precisely as it is given to a velocipede on
shore. The novel craft is easily propelled at the rate
of six miles an hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A gentleman of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., has invented
and uses an Ice Velocipede, which he propels with
astonishing rapidity. The frame of this velocipede
is built like those which are commonly used in this
city. It has but one wheel, steered with a bar as in
the land machine, but armed with sharp points to
prevent its slipping. Instead of the wheel behind
are two sharp runners, like those attached to the ice
boats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

</div>

<p>A Steam Velocipede has also been invented, from
which great speed is expected. The cylinders and
their attachments to the two driving wheels are not
shown. They are placed vertically in front of the
boiler, between it and the seat, and connect with
cranks on the shaft of the driving wheels. The engraving
shows the position of the boiler relatively to
the other parts of the machine. The engine is a
direct acting compound engine of two cylinders,
each cylinder two and a half inches diameter, and
five inches stroke. The steering gear consists of an
endless chain over a grooved wheel on the engine
shaft, and passing over a corresponding wheel fixed
between the forked shaft just over the front. The
latter grooved wheel is a wide one, and over it passes
another chain. This latter chain works round the
boss of the front wheel. This arrangement gives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
power to the front wheel, so that in turning a corner,
this wheel takes a wider sweep than the two driving wheels,
which go first. In travelling on a straight
road (backwards) the machine is turned to either
side by turning the steering wheel to the opposite
side. The boiler is a vertical one, with four tubes,
one and a half inches internal diameter, hanging
down by the side of the fire-box. The fire-grate is
cast with four holes in it to receive the bottom ends
of the tubes so as to hold them firmly. Height of
boiler, two feet six inches; height of fire-box, fifteen
inches; diameter of fire-box, eleven inches; diameter
of boiler, fourteen inches. The fire-box and tubes
are copper, pressure two hundred pounds; but twenty-five
pounds of steam will be equal to a velocipede
propelled by the feet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Philadelphia has recently produced a velocipede of
an entirely new style. There are but two wheels,
the seat sitting quite low between them. The novelty
consists in a cog attached to the guiding-post, by
means of which the rear wheel is made to follow
directly in the track of the forward wheel. No
matter how short the turn, both wheels make it at
the same time, and the seat always remains parallel
with the driving wheel. In other machines there is
no guide to the rear wheel, and consequently the
machine cannot be turned so readily when a collision
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
is threatened. The new machine, which is called the
“Keystone,” in honor of its native State, is substantially
built, and so far as it has been tested in the
riding school, is pronounced a success.</p>

<p>There is an ingenious gentleman in Cincinnati,
who is at work constructing a velocipede to be propelled
by a spring, on the principle of a watch.
After winding it up, he calculates that it will move
two miles before it will require winding.</p>

<p>A gentleman in Albany has arranged a velocipede
to run on railroad tracks. The wheels have flanges
to them, so that they cannot leave the rails. The
flanges are so arranged as to be removed when
occasion requires, so as to make the machine available
on ordinary roads. The inventor claims fifty
miles an hour.</p>

<p>An expert velocipedestrian in the West, has had
rubber tires put upon the wheels of his vehicle; and
finds by their use, he can ride in winter over snow
and ice without slipping, and that in summer he is
much relieved of the jar from roughnesses of roads.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the new velocipedes of which
we hear daily, prove total failures on trial. Most of
their inventors proceed upon abstract principles, and
fall into absurdities, from which previous practical
knowledge would have saved them.</p>

VELOCIPEDES FOR LADIES.</h2>
</div>

<p>We present a bicycle for ladies, lately invented
and patented by Messrs. Pickering &amp; Davis of New
York City. It will be seen that the reach or frame,
instead of forming a nearly straight line from the
front swivel to the hind axle, follows the curve of the
front wheel until it reaches a line nearly as low as
the hind axle, when it runs horizontally to that point
of the hind wheel. The two wheels being separated
three or four inches, allow of an upright rod being
secured to the reach; around this is a spiral spring,
on which a comfortable, cane-seated, willow-backed
chair is placed. This machine, with a moderate sized
wheel (of thirty to thirty-three inches), will allow
being driven with a great deal of comfort and all the
advantages of the two-wheel <i>veloce</i>. In mounting,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
a lady has to step over the reach, at a point only
twelve inches from the floor, the height of an ordinary
step in a flight of stairs.</p>

<p>A machine for ladies has also been invented by
S. T. Derry of Boston, and patented by Messrs.
Sargent and Derry, which in construction and appearance
is very similar to the one just described.
Its saddle is of velvet on springs, giving a perfectly
elastic seat; it is furnished with mud fenders in front
and behind, and is complete in every respect.</p>

<p>Both these machines have been examined by
experts and pronounced satisfactory. It will be
readily seen that they obviate many of the difficulties,
embarrassments, and objectionable features of
the bicycle. They will, doubtless, become popular.
While young men have been dashing about on velocipedes,
many young women have looked on with
envy and emulation. They have not been satisfied
with the tricycle designed for their especial use; and
have felt it hard that they should be denied the
exercise, amusement, risk, dash, and delightful independence,
which the bicycle so abundantly affords.</p>

<p>It is possible that our young ladies will rush into
velocipeding as they have into skating, and other
athletic amusements. It would be a substitute, in
many cases, for the expensive luxury of horseback
exercise, and has the advantages over it, of convenience
and pleasure as well as cost. Velocipeding will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
be particularly nice for suburban ladies, who have
smooth roads around them, over which they may
bowl to their hearts’ content, and drive themselves
from house to house on morning calls. It will not
be necessary to keep an ostler, nor to have an attendant
to assist in mounting and to accompany the
rider. When ready for her ride, a lady may take her
horse from the front hall, clean and fresh, mount, and
be off. It would be a bright and beautiful day for
our land, should a laudable and reasonable ambition
once fairly get possession of our young women, to
cultivate and develop their physical natures, and to
become strong, healthy, robust, and enduring.</p>

<p>A short time since, “The Revolution” published
an able article recommending the use of the bicycle
to ladies. It has been used by them for some time
in a quiet way, and to a much greater extent than is
generally supposed. There are classes for ladies in
almost every large city; and many are waiting for
fine weather, to enjoy the art in the open air, instead
of a closely confined room; and to “Witch the world
with noble horsemanship.”</p>

<p>The idea has been conceived from seeing experts
ride side-saddle fashion, and drive the machine with
one foot, that ladies might begin by learning the art
in that way. This would be well nigh impossible,
though it is easy enough after one is proficient. But
with a proper teacher of their own sex, and with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
suitable dresses for preliminary practice, ladies can
soon obtain such a command over the vehicle, that
they can ride side-saddle wise with perfect ease.</p>

<p>A lady must begin with great moderation, and
train her muscles to the work of propulsion, or they
will cry out vehemently at first. Above all, she
must avoid getting cold, rheumatism, and neuralgia,
after being heated by the exercise.</p>

<p>The best school for ladies is established in Boston,
and is conducted in a properly private and exclusive
manner. It is supplied with a number of lady
teachers and assistants, all under the direction of the
best “velocipedagogue” in the city. It is in a large
hall in a good locality, and is provided with the best
French machines, dressing-rooms, and other conveniences.
Many good old Boston names are to be
found upon the list of pupils. The lessons are
twenty-five dollars for a course of instruction, with a
guarantee of proficiency.</p>

<p>There is also a school especially designed for ladies,
at the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fourteenth Street,
New York, at what is known as the Somerville Art
Gallery. This has two halls of an area of 3,000
square feet. One of the halls is set apart for beginners,
and the other for those more advanced.</p>

<p>Ladies, in riding the bicycle, commonly use the
modest and appropriate costume worn by them in
calisthenic exercises and in the gymnasium. Another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
very suitable dress for the <i>velocipedestrienne</i> has been
thus described:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Let the outer dress skirt be made so as to button
its entire length in front; the back part should be made
to button from the bottom, to a point about three-eighths
of a yard up the skirt. This arrangement does
not detract at all from the appearance of an ordinary
walking costume. When the wearer wishes to prepare
for a drive, she simply loosens two or three of
the lower buttons at the front and back and bringing
together the two ends of each side, separately, buttons
them in this way around each ankle. This gives a
full skirt around each ankle, and, when mounted, the
dress falls gracefully at each side of the front wheel.”</p>

<p>Miss Carrie Augusta Moore, well-known in amusement
circles as “The Skatorial Queen,” has been
riding the bicycle in public in Washington, Boston,
and the Western cities, with much success. Her
riding is described as finished and graceful, and her
costume as neat and modest.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VELOCIPEDE_SCHOOLS_AND_RINKS">
VELOCIPEDE SCHOOLS AND RINKS.</h2>
</div>

<p>Those who have thought the rage for velocipedes
would be fleeting and evanescent, have found
themselves much mistaken. Velocipede “Schools,”
“Halls,” “Rinks,” “Institutes,” and “Academies,”
have sprung into existence with mushroom rapidity.
There are scores in our large cities, and one or more in
almost every country town. They secure a patronage
which is not only surprising, as indicating the extent
to which the enthusiasm prevails; but also as showing
that the desire to ride is not confined to any
particular age, or to any class of persons. We have
seen astride the bicycle in the same rink, the old and
the young, the fat man and the lean, the doctor, who
does not believe that the fashionable exercise develops
one set of muscles to the detriment of others; the
clergyman, a regular muscular Christian; and the
newsboy who has sold his papers in the cold and
rain to accumulate the funds to make him as much
the privileged character as any nabob. We have
witnessed the lawyer, the tradesman, and the mechanic,
spinning with ease and grace. We have
watched the lounger who fringes the edge of society
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
with his delicate moustache, making his languid
attempt; we have seen the artist mount his Pegasus,
and the professor of literature, striving with noble
persistency to emulate his much envied tutor. There
is a marked fascination in the exercise which affects
alike the spectators and the participants. Those who
come to look, remain to ride; and those, who once
bestride “the wheeled Rosinante,” refuse to quit
until they have tamed the unaccustomed steed.</p>

<p>It is very amusing to watch the eager pupils, going
through their novitiate. The beginners mount,
struggle, perspire, and tumble in all directions and
shapes; and blunders, awkward movements, collisions,
and shipwrecks follow each other in constant
succession. The more advanced ride with “This
one thing I do,” manifest upon every feature; and
one would suppose, from looking at their compressed
lips, knit brows, and fixed eyes, that they felt they
were guiding, like Phaëton, the horses of the Sun.
The graduates and proficients ride with charming
ease, carelessness, and control.</p>

<p>“The early bird catches the worm,” is a proverb
particularly applicable to those who first started
velocipede schools. All the rinks, schools, academies,
and “velocipedagogues,” do a large business; and
their machines pay for themselves in a short time.</p>

<p>The fever is not confined to the Eastern and
Middle States, but rages throughout the South and
West.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
In some of the velocipede riding halls, a charge is
made for a series of ten lessons; at others, there is
an admittance fee, and a certain price per hour for
using the machine. In our cities, we have them to
suit all classes and conditions of people. They
range from the rinks in common localities, with their
sawdust floors, cheap machines, and nominal admission
fees, where the “timid toddlers” go it alone,
to the schools in the marble blocks, with their French
machines and experienced teachers.</p>

<p>As our knowledge increases, our tastes become
more luxurious. The plebeian is content with his
wagon, but the patrician must have his <i>coupé</i>. The
beginner asks no better accommodation than is afforded
by the New Bedford machine; but one of the
“do it gracefuls,” or one of the “fancy few” must
have spring work, ornamental mountings, bright varnish,
and no sawdust under him; else he fails to experience
the acme of bicycular enjoyment.</p>

<p>Among the most popular velocipede schools in
New York city, are those of the Pearsall Brothers,
corner of Broadway and Twenty-second Street;
Hanlon Brothers, corner of Broadway and Tenth
Street; Calvin Witty, 638 Broadway; Mercer &amp;
Monod, No. 3 Williams Street; and Barber &amp; Pendleton,
corner of Broadway and Forty-seventh Street.</p>

<p>The Pearsall Brothers formerly occupied prominent
and lucrative positions with Messrs. Gurney &amp; Son,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
photographers. They foresaw the future popularity
of the velocipede, and abandoned photography for
velocipeding with immediate success. They opened
the first school in New York, and have the names
of some five hundred or more pupils on their lists.
They have a velocipede ware-room under their hall.</p>

<p>The Hanlon Brothers, well-known as gymnasts,
have the reputation of being the best riders in the
country. Their hall is the largest in New York, and
is furnished with twenty-five first-class machines.
They lately gave a “Velocipede Reception and Hop;”
and exhibited many graceful and daring feats upon
the bicycle; afterwards other gentlemen also gave
proof of their skill, among them, Charles A. Dana,
Editor of the “New York Sun,” who is an expert
rider.</p>

<p>The largest and most popular school in Brooklyn
is under the direction of Mr. A. C. Burnham. At all
these schools, velocipede receptions and exhibitions
are of almost nightly occurrence, and create much
interest.</p>

<p>Messrs. Crawford &amp; Co., of Philadelphia, have a
large school, corner of Eighth and Callowhill Streets,
where they use a velocipede of their own construction,
in which the rear wheel is used as the
guiding wheel.</p>

<p>Messrs. Mercer &amp; Monod, of New York, have a
flourishing branch school in Philadelphia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>The Pearsall Brothers have one in Detroit, Mich.,
and another in Chicago, Ill. The large Zouave Hall
in Chicago, under the direction of Geo. D. Miles, has
become a noted velocipede academy. The Nicholson
pavement, much used in Chicago, is admirably
adapted to this kind of propulsion, and the riders
soon leave the rinks for the streets. Chicago hails
any invention of a fast nature, and the velocipede
has already become a practical institution there.</p>

<p>There is no place where the velocipede <i>furore</i> has
developed more rapidly or to a greater extent than in
Boston. There are over twenty schools and rinks in
the city; and no less than eleven on Washington
Street, between the Old South Church and Chester
Square. The first school in Boston was opened by
S. T. Derry of the firm of Wm. H. Sargent &amp; Co.,
at 155 Tremont Street. At this school the course
of instruction is thorough and complete, and all pupils
graduate experts. Six different sizes of French
pattern velocipedes are used, and the scholar is advanced
from one to the other, according to progress.
Though this is a private school, there are the names
of hundreds of graduates upon its lists. Mr. Derry
is an accomplished teacher. He has several other
schools under his charge, and has made arrangements
to lease the Skating Rink for the same purpose.</p>

<p>The first public rink opened in Boston, was near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
Bowdoin Square (No. 7 Greene Street), and has
been deservedly popular. The proprietors have had
branch rinks in Cambridgeport, Brighton, and other
neighboring towns.</p>

<p>The fashionable Horticultural Hall was transformed
into a first-class velocipede academy for a
limited time. This academy was provided with
coat rooms, dressing rooms, and other conveniences;
and with seats and accommodations for ladies.
Tournaments and races here followed each other in
rapid succession.</p>

<p>Among the other popular rinks in Boston, are
those of Kimball Brothers, 113 Court Street; Walter
Brown, 179 Court Street; Horace M. Sargent, Boylston
Hall; Macy &amp; Butler, 90 and 92 Tremont Street;
at 334 Washington Street; at Arlington Hall; and
at Riddle’s Carriage Repository, Haymarket Square.</p>

<p>The two best and largest rinks in the United
States are to be found at Harvard Square, Cambridge.
One of them has twelve thousand square
feet of floor, and twenty-five good machines. The
other, built by Mr. John C. Stiles, is in the form of
an amphitheatre, and has a circular course of a little
less than an eighth of a mile in length. Only part
of the track is under cover. At night, this rink is
brilliantly lighted, and the scene is at once novel
and inspiring. Scores of riders rush madly after
each other at break-neck speed, round and round
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
the arena. We have seen an expert whirl over the
course in seventeen seconds, which is nearly as good
time as any recorded abroad, and better than any
heretofore made in this country. The students of
“Old Harvard” crowd these rinks; the billiard halls
and other places of resort are deserted, and all are
eager votaries of the fascinating art.</p>

<p>But one thing is likely to interfere with the bicycle
campaign in our large cities and towns; and that is
the difficulty of finding suitable places to ride in.
Our latest hobby is already ridden with remarkable
fury in the streets, and will continue to be so, by
those who make the machine a means of utility.
Foot passengers, however, claim the sidewalks as
their exclusive rights; and will hardly be pleased to

<p>and those who ride for amusement, are anxiously
looking for suitable places, where they can do so
without annoyance to passers, or being interfered
with by them; where they can see and be seen; and
where their skill can be admired.</p>

<p>But velocipede tracks are now in preparation.
Race-courses will be free to the bicycle, velocipede
stables will open in their vicinity, and the proprietors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
will rapidly line their pockets. All the skating
ponds will be metamorphosed into velocipedariums
and velocipede rinks. These will make capital exercise
grounds, where numberless riders can make
their graceful curves to the music of a good band;
and where, in hot summer weather, they can be protected
from the sun by awnings. The large parks
will be open to velocipedestrians.</p>

<p>It has been currently reported that the Commissioners
of Central Park, New York, have prohibited
the driving of the bicycle there; but the rumor is
without foundation. No such interdict will be issued,
unless the blooded horses object to the novel
machine, by running away. Well-bred horses,
whether thorough-bred or not, already manifest no
emotion at the sight of the vehicle. Without doubt,
the Commissioners will yield gracefully to the public
demand.</p>

<p>In New York, a project has been advocated of
building an elevated railway, from Harlem to the
Battery, to be used only by velocipede riders. On
such a railway, thirty feet wide, and with a flooring
of hard pine, it would be possible to go from one
end of Manhattan Island to the other in about an
hour, making allowance for delays, from stoppages
and accidents. A good rider, with a clear track,
could easily accomplish the distance in half an
hour; but, with a well-filled road, progress would
necessarily be slower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
In Prospect and Washington Parks, Brooklyn, the
bicycle votaries are allowed the same privileges as
equestrians. Many of the level streets of that city,
with the Nicholson and concrete pavements, furnish
a capital surface for the velocipedestrians, and are
great resorts. It is even said, that the benign City
Fathers propose to bridge the gutters for their accommodation.</p>

<p>The residents of Boston will find good riding
grounds, easy of access to the city, on many of the
smooth roads of its beautiful suburbs.</p>

<p>Philadelphians can ride the velocipede on their
straight, level streets. We know of no place so
admirably adapted to the bicycle, as Broad Street,
Philadelphia, with its miles of Nicholson pavement.</p>

<h3 id="VELOCIPEDE_RACING">VELOCIPEDE RACING.</h3>

<p>Another feature of the velocipede campaign, will
be races against time, and contests of rival riders.
Fast and slow races for money, silver cups, and
other prizes, follow each other night after night in
most of our rinks. All the race-courses will be
used for this purpose. A provision for this sort of
sport is in progress, at the Capitoline Ball-ground,
Brooklyn, where in May a half-mile track of smooth
hard road-way will be ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
The managers of the Prospect Park Association,
of the same place, have made arrangements to signalize
their first spring meeting for 1869, with a
grand velocipede tournament; at which prizes
amounting to $1,500 will be given for the best time,
to the winners of a series of races. These races will
be governed by a special code of rules, which will
include handicapping for weight of machines and
riders, diameter of driving wheel, and extent of
treadles. There will be first, second, and third prizes
for the greatest speed; prizes for the best time
made; and prizes for slow riding. This tournament
will afford, not only an excellent opportunity
for the display of skill in American velocipede riding,
but also a fair chance to show off the merits of
the different styles of machines. It will create an
excitement, and it is anticipated that many thousand
people will be present.</p>

<p>The proprietors of Riverside Park, near Boston,
also intend to inaugurate a series of bicycle contests
on their course during the ensuing summer.</p>

<p>At the last annual meeting of the Housatonic
Agricultural Society of Berkshire County, Mass., a
vote was passed, offering premiums for bicycle races,
at the next exhibition and fair.</p>

<p>Velocipede races are now a feature of the French
turf meetings. These are less cruel, and more attractive
and exciting, than running horses under
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
whip and spur. In the suburbs of Paris, a race of
this kind is especially interesting. The village in
which it takes place is in holiday guise; banners
flaunt gaily, and eagles, wreaths, and flowers are to
be seen in every direction. The mayor is usually
present, with a red, white, and blue scarf, his badge
of office. The riders wear jockey caps and silk
jackets, and at the moment of starting are drawn
up abreast. The fair sex mount their chairs, wave
their hands, flourish their handkerchiefs, laugh, and
scream with delight as their favorites start at the signal.
In spite of the exertions of the <i>gendarmes</i>, the
crowd closes in behind the contestants, who are soon
lost to sight. In a few moments, however, distant
shouts and cheers announce the return; and the
crowd opens, to allow the passage of the victor,
who passes the winning-post amidst great applause.</p>

<p>The fastest time which has thus far been made in
France, was one mile in two minutes and fourteen
seconds. There is a record also, of two miles having
been made in four minutes and fifty-six seconds.
This extraordinary speed was attained on a perfect
track, with large-wheeled machines.</p>

<p>Among the velocipede wagers which have had
place in our newspapers, we mention one or two of
the more remarkable. It is said that a Providence
pedestrian and rope-walker is to commence, on the
first day of June next, the unparalleled feat of propelling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
a velocipede of his own manufacture, a distance
of three thousand miles in thirty days, averaging
one hundred miles per day, for a wager of
$5,000. During the trip, he is to ride the velocipede
one hundred and fifty miles in twenty-four hours,
and one trial only will be allowed.</p>

<p>Two New York gentlemen have wagered $1,500
a side to ride from New York to Chicago. Articles
of agreement have been drawn up and signed with
a forfeit of $250 each.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VELOCIPEDE_LITERATURE">VELOCIPEDE LITERATURE.</h2>
</div>

<p>Until very recently, velocipede literature has been
confined to some few magazine articles, editorials
in scientific, illustrated, and other newspapers, and
various and constant newspaper squibs.</p>

<p>Now, however, the velocipedestrians have a novelty
in a paper of their own, which has made its appearance
in New York. It is to be published monthly
by Messrs. Pickering &amp; Davis. It is a quarto
of eight pages, and is entitled “The Velocipedist.”
“The object this paper has in view, is to record
everything of interest in the velocipede world.” It
is edited by W. Chester King, late of Athens,
Greece, whom Horace Greeley, in the “Tribune” of
February 1st, 1869, justly styles a “brilliant and
accomplished young litterateur.” This young gentleman
has distinguished himself, in a marked manner,
in various branches of journalism; and “in
velocipede literature he is as far ahead of his contemporaries
as, in Virgil, Tityrus tells us, Rome was
in advance of other cities.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VELOCIPATHY">VELOCIPATHY.</h2>
</div>

<p class="h2sub">THE VELOCIPEDE FROM A MEDICAL STAND-POINT.</p>

<p>The vast majority of people are almost wholly
responsible for their physical condition. Bodily
strength and sound health, like mental accomplishments,
are the results of cultivation; and the greater
part of mankind can as easily obtain them, as they
can acquire a knowledge of Mathematics in school
or college.</p>

<p>Let any one place, side by side, the closely confined
student or clerk, and the man who has paid
special attention to his physical culture. Compare
the pale or sallow face, the flat chest, the narrow,
stooping shoulders of the former, with the development
of the latter, whose vigorous frame defies disease,
whose strength gives a consciousness of power
that makes him fearless of danger, and who can exult
in that greatest earthly possession, exuberant health.
These two classes of men will be the fathers of the
next generation. The great disparity between them
can be obviated by physical training on the part of
the former. If not, then, merely as a means of happiness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
to ourselves, is it not a duty we owe to succeeding
generations, that we cultivate these means of
raising man to the summit of his nature, physically
as well as mentally?</p>

<p>The condition of civilization (if one avoids its
vices), does not weaken bodily vigor, provided the
locomotive system is kept in thorough activity. The
masses should not only have the necessary amount
of exercise in the open air, but a perfect exercise of
every muscle in the body.</p>

<p>A neglect of the powers with which our Creator
has endowed us, is punished by their withdrawal.
Allow the intellect to remain idle and it will become
sluggish. All parts of the human organism not
sufficiently worked, are liable to degenerate; the
nerve force which should guide and govern is allowed
to sleep; the muscles become inelastic fibre
of but little vitality. Tie up an arm for months and
it withers away. Let the muscles of our young
men and delicate young ladies remain idle; they
degenerate and atrophy.</p>

<p>“Everything that prolongs human life, ameliorates
human suffering, elevates and develops the
human frame, is an element of progress; an element
that all true men admire and cherish.”</p>

<p>The velocipede is one of the finest inventions of
the nineteenth century. It is a physiologically constructed
machine; is an invaluable means of promoting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
health, and bids fair to emancipate our
youth from the common muscular lethargy and
debility.</p>

<p>Velocipeding is superior to skating, horseback
riding, base-ball, and rowing. While skating is
good for the legs, horseback riding for the chest,
base-ball and rowing for the legs and arms, the benefit
derived from exercise on the velocipede is not
local. <i>It gives a natural exercise and general development
to every muscle of the body.</i> The arms are
the first to feel the effect of the exercise, for the
pressure of the feet upon the stirrups must be met
by a corresponding pressure of the hands on the
tiller, necessary to prevent the front wheel from turning.
This pressure of the tiller against the hands
puts the rider in an upright position, with elbows
well back and hands well extended, straightens the
stooping shoulders, facilitates respiration, expands
the lungs, and develops the chest. No position can
be maintained upon the velocipede, inconsistent
with ease and elegance of motion, or incompatible
with the laws of health.</p>

<p>Some physicians of prominence have pronounced
against the velocipede, and one has issued a pronunciamento
advising young men to shun it, but the
majority of the profession give it their hearty and
cordial support. Medical men are among its most
eager votaries. One of the best physicians in our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
country, who makes diseases of the lungs a specialty,
rides the bicycle two hours a day, and prescribes it
for his patients. He considers it a great preventive
of that scourge of our climate, consumption; and a
grand aid to the development and improvement of
the human body. Many busy men of the profession
in New York, Boston, and other large cities, either
have their own machines, or ride daily in the schools
and rinks. They regard this preparation of Iron (the
velocipede), as better than any in their Materia
Medica.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
